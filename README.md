üö® Docker Note

> Due to local system storage limits (Docker build consumed over 20GB), I was unable to run the final Docker container after a successful build.

‚úÖ docker-compose build ran successfully.

‚úÖ Dockerfile and Compose config were finalized (Gunicorn, PostgreSQL, collectstatic, health check).

‚ùå Final docker-compose up could not be executed due to system memory constraints.


If needed, this can be easily tested in a higher-resource machine or cloud CI/CD environment.
